Language Learning Toolkit
=======

The Language Learning Toolkit combines several approaches such as natural language processing and web scraping to perform a variety of tasks useful for language learning.
This includes:
 * Part-of-speech tagging (POS) supported by [Pattern](http://github.com/clips/pattern)
 * Phonetic transcriptions in accordance with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
 * Audiosamples ([Forvo](http://www.forvo.com/), Google Translate)
 * Textsamples/Sample sentences ([Tatoeba](http://tatoeba.org/))
 * Visual representations of a given word using Google Images
 * Conjugation of verbs (Present, Perfect, Past, Pluperfect, Future)
 * Pluralization of nouns (accuracy depending on the language)
 * Indefinite and definite articles for nouns (accuracy depending on the language)
 * Comparative and superlative for adjectives
 * Basic gender detection for nouns
